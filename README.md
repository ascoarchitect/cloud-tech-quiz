# Cloud Skills Assessment Platform

A comprehensive assessment platform designed for evaluating cloud skills knowledge and preparing for certification exams.

## üìã Overview

This application provides a platform for creating, managing, and taking skills practice tests to allow organisations to get a reflection of areas of strength and improvement across your engineers. It allows administrators to create customised tests with various question types, while users can test their knowledge in a simulated exam environment.

Whilst there are many exam simulation tools (paid and free) available, this provides the ability to host your own serverless solution with centralised reporting across a number of skills tracks. The tool can also be used for non-technical assessments based on your own organisational requirements with the ability to create bespoke categories and questions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a modern serverless architecture pattern built entirely on AWS services:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single-Page Application**: React-based SPA hosted on S3 and distributed via CloudFront
- **Authentication Flow**: Integrates with Amazon Cognito using JWT tokens for secure authentication
- **State Management**: React context API for global state (AuthContext)
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes based on authentication status and user roles
- **UI Framework**: Material UI components with responsive design

### Backend Architecture
- **API Layer**: REST API built with Amazon API Gateway with Cognito authorizers
- **Business Logic**: Lambda functions handling CRUD operations for questions, tests, and responses
- **Database Layer**:
  - DynamoDB tables with GSIs for efficient querying
  - `QuestionTable`: Stores questions with category/difficulty indexes
  - `TestTable`: Manages test configurations and settings
  - `ResponseTable`: Tracks user test attempts and results
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Cognito User Pools for identity management
  - User groups (Admin, User) for role-based permissions
  - JWT token validation for API access

### Security Features
- **Anti-Cheating System**: Detects tab switching, copy/paste operations, and suspicious behavior
- **API Authorization**: API Gateway with Cognito authorizers to validate JWT tokens
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict origin policies to prevent unauthorized access
- **Content Delivery**: CloudFront with origin access identities for secure S3 access

### Deployment Architecture
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS SAM templates for consistent deployments
- **Resource Naming**: Environment-based naming conventions for multi-environment support
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for secure cross-origin requests
- **CloudFront Distribution**: Efficient global content delivery with proper cache settings

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Test Creation Flow
1. Administrator creates questions in the question bank through the admin interface
2. Questions are categorized and tagged for organization
3. Administrator creates a test by specifying parameters (difficulty, categories, time limit)
4. Test configuration is stored in DynamoDB with reference to selected questions

### Test-Taking Flow
1. User logs in via Cognito authentication
2. User enters a test ID to access a specific assessment
3. System validates test availability and eligibility
4. Anti-cheating module initializes to monitor user behavior
5. Questions are presented according to test configuration (random or sequential)
6. User responses are periodically saved to prevent data loss
7. System tracks time spent on each question and overall test
8. User submits test or time expires
9. System calculates score and generates detailed results
10. Results are stored for historical analysis and improvement tracking
